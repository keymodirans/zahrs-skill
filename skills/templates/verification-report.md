### {phase}-{next}-PLAN.md: {Fix Name}

**Objective:** {What this fixes}

**Tasks:**

## Verification Metadata

**Verification approach:** Goal-backward (derived from phase goal)
**Must-haves source:** {PLAN.md frontmatter | derived from ROADMAP.md goal}
**Automated checks:** {N} passed, {M} failed
**Human checks required:** {N}
**Total verification time:** {duration}

---
*Verified: {timestamp}*
*Verifier: Claude (subagent)*
```

---

## Guidelines

**Status values:**
- `passed` — All must-haves verified, no blockers
- `gaps_found` — One or more critical gaps found
- `human_needed` — Automated checks pass but human verification required

**Evidence types:**
- For EXISTS: "File at path, exports X"
- For SUBSTANTIVE: "N lines, has patterns X, Y, Z"
- For WIRED: "Line N: code that connects A to B"
- For FAILED: "Missing because X" or "Stub because Y"

**Severity levels:**
- [BLOCK] Blocker: Prevents goal achievement, must fix
- [!] Warning: Indicates incomplete but doesn't block
- [INFO] Info: Notable but not problematic

**Fix plan generation:**
- Only generate if gaps_found
- Group related fixes into single plans
- Keep to 2-3 tasks per plan
- Include verification task in each plan

# Phase 3: Chat Interface Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Working chat interface where users can send and receive messages
**Verified:** 2025-01-15T14:30:00Z
**Status:** gaps_found

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | User can see existing messages | [X] FAILED | Component renders placeholder, not message data |
| 2 | User can type a message | [OK] VERIFIED | Input field exists with onChange handler |
| 3 | User can send a message | [X] FAILED | onSubmit handler is console.log only |
| 4 | Sent message appears in list | [X] FAILED | No state update after send |
| 5 | Messages persist across refresh | [?] UNCERTAIN | Can't verify - send doesn't work |

**Score:** 1/5 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |

| `src/components/ChatInput.tsx` | Message input | [OK] EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE | Form with input, submit button, handlers |
| `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` | Message CRUD | [X] STUB | GET returns [], POST returns { ok: true } |
| `prisma/schema.prisma` | Message model | [OK] EXISTS + SUBSTANTIVE | Message model with id, content, userId, createdAt |

**Artifacts:** 2/4 verified

### Key Link Verification

| src/app/api/chat/route.ts | 5 | `return Response.json([])` | [BLOCK] Blocker | Hardcoded empty |
| src/app/api/chat/route.ts | 12 | `// TODO: save to database` | [!] Warning | Incomplete |

**Anti-patterns:** 3 found (2 blockers, 1 warning)

## Human Verification Required

None needed until automated gaps are fixed.

## Gaps Summary

### Critical Gaps (Block Progress)

1. **Chat component is placeholder**
   - Missing: Actual message list rendering
   - Impact: Users see "Chat will be here" instead of messages
   - Fix: Implement Chat.tsx to fetch and render messages

2. **API routes are stubs**
   - Missing: Database integration in GET and POST
   - Impact: No data persistence, no real functionality
   - Fix: Wire prisma calls in route handlers

3. **No wiring between frontend and backend**
   - Missing: fetch calls in components
   - Impact: Even if API worked, UI wouldn't call it
   - Fix: Add useEffect fetch in Chat, onSubmit fetch in ChatInput

## Recommended Fix Plans

### 03-04-PLAN.md: Implement Chat API

**Objective:** Wire API routes to database

**Tasks:**
1. Implement GET /api/chat with prisma.message.findMany
2. Implement POST /api/chat with prisma.message.create
3. Verify: API returns real data, POST creates records

**Estimated scope:** Small

---

### 03-05-PLAN.md: Implement Chat UI

**Objective:** Wire Chat component to API

**Tasks:**
1. Implement Chat.tsx with useEffect fetch and message rendering
2. Wire ChatInput onSubmit to POST /api/chat
3. Verify: Messages display, new messages appear after send

**Estimated scope:** Small
